    <p>Working dogs perform many important jobs to help us all. One of these jobs is to assist police officers in protecting us. The dog in the photo above is one of those special dogs.</p>
    <p> This dog is named Slim and he was featured on PetCentral on Chewy.com.</p>
    <p> Slim's partner is quoted in the article as stating, "Slim stayed the course and found the bad guy. His success can be chalked up to police training, and the canine's powerful sense of smell. Even after years of seeing Slim in action, Corcoran is still in awe of his powerful tracking abilities." </p>

    <h2>Hero Dogs</h2>
    <img src="https://www.mediafire.com/convkey/9bee/2qwa4q0wmz7whth6g.jpg" alt="Hero Dogs Photo">
    <p>Dogs can be heroes. One truly heroic dog is in the photo above from AKC.org.</p>
    <p>"Named one of history's most heroic animals by Time magazine, Trakr was a German Shepherd Dog who, along with his handler, dug through the debris at the World Trade Center and located the last survivor of the 9/11 attack."</p>
    <p>Dogs can also be heroes by saving the lives of their owners by finding help when they need it the most</p>
    <p>It takes a very special dog to be a hero.</p>
